Event Listeners in javascript
-----------------------------
An standard example demonstrating the use of Event listeners (globally) in Javascript. When using Event Listeners globally you can use ```event.target.matches``` to "listen" for events executed on **multiple HTML elements** at the same time, all in one go! This makes it easier to set up Event Listeners in your HTML document or app. (you simply identify elements to be manipulated by HTML element name, CSS class name or CSS ID) <br>
